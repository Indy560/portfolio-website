		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>I work to understand the needs of real people in real scenarios. Creating something that makes someone's life better, 
		<br>or an opportunity to take something that is broken and figure out how to make it work as it was originally intended
		<br>through UX design is my passion. With targeted and strategic questioning, I learn from stakeholders and end-users
		<br>and develop a clear understanding of what people want and how they want it and bring that information to developers
		<br>so we can build tools that are intuitive, powerful, and a pleasure to use.</p>
