		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>I work to understand the needs of real people in real scenarios. Creating something that makes someone's life better, 
		or an opportunity to take something that is broken and figure out how to make it work as it was originally intended
		through UX design is my passion. With targeted and strategic questioning, I learn from stakeholders and end-users
		and develop a clear understanding of what people want and how they want it and bring that information to developers
		so we can build tools that are intuitive, powerful, and a pleasure to use.
